# Digit-Recognition

<h3>Dataset description</h3>
MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker. 

Keras is a high-level neural network API focused on user friendliness, fast prototyping, modularity and extensibility. It works with deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Theano and CNTK, so we can get right into building and training a neural network without a lot of fuss.

I've used the VGG Convoluted Neural Network for image classification. The final test accuracy achieved was 99.45%.
